(This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add contacts to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data. Read the guide). - Update a contact, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call). - Delete a contact, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call). # Demo-Link `<link>`: [Contact Manager App](https://contact-manager-app-project.netlify.app/)",
